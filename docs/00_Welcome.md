# SPHS Computer Science Club

### Purpose
This site will serve as a single place to have all of the content and documentation relating to the club. You can think of this as a sort of "Blackboard" style system for us all to have access to the same content.



### Getting Started

Click one of the items on the left to view contents of that category. Go ahead and give clicking on **Labs** a try to see the content of the labs.



### Updates

This site will be updated at least once a week.
